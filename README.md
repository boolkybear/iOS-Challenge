# iOS-Challenge

This is a sample application consuming services from The Cat API (http://thecatapi.com/), written in Swift

You can watch view pictures, rate them and set favourites. As the votes and favourites require an API Key and this section is not working (http://thecatapi.com/api-key-registration.html), this is saved locally using CoreData.
